# DNA Sequence Translator

This is a Python program that translates a DNA sequence into a corresponding sequence of amino acids. It uses a table dictionary to map nucleotide triplets (codons) to their respective amino acids. The program reads a DNA sequence from a file, removes any special characters, and translates it into a protein sequence using the table dictionary.
